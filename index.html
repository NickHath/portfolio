      <article>
        <p>BreadCrumb is a simple dashboard for creating and managing scavenger hunts. It allows anyone to dispatch scavenger hunts to participants using just their phone numbers. I thought that it was important to keep the barrier for participating in hunts as low as possible, so I used <a href="https://www.twilio.com/sms" target="_blank">Twilio’s SMS API</a> to coordinate hunts after they were created in the dashboard. In other words, potential users can participate in scavenger hunts without creating an account.</p>

        <p>I have always loved scavenger hunts. In high school, I would create them regularly them for friends and family. I thought that it would be fun to have a tool that made creating scavenger hunts as easy as writing prompts into an editor and then automating participants’ progress using texts.</p>

          <li>Friends wanting to make a loved one’s birthday unique</li>
          <li>College RA’s wanting to make their freshman orientation weeks more interactive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also knew that an answer that was incredibly close, but not an exact match would ruin the experience for users. So, I used the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/natural" target="_blank">Natural package</a> to create my own fuzzy comparison (allowing "Mario’s" as an answer for "Mario’s Pizza").</p>

      <article>
        <p>After finishing BreadCrumb, I demoed it to 20+ participants by hiding 100 stickers around DevMountain’s campus and creating a scavenger hunt that led participants to them. I was also awarded Best Overall / Most Shippable for my cohort. Creating this full-stack website was an incredible learning experience. In the future, I would like to rebuild the front-end as a React-Native app and also support image uploads as well as text responses for the hunts.</p>

      <h1>Description</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Date Idea Generator was made for people who feel stuck in a rut. Using Yelp’s API, it pulls in local restaurants, parks, cafes, bars, and more to randomize dates. Once a user has provided their location and time, they can randomize their results by shaking their phone or pressing the space bar. If they like a location, they can lock it in. If one of their results is close, but not perfect, they can lock it in by category.</p>
        <p>I built Date Idea Generator with three other developers while we were students at DevMountain.</p>

      <article>
        <p>If you’ve ever brainstormed with a romantic partner about what to do on a Friday night, but decided to watch Netflix instead, then you understand exactly why we decided to build Date Idea Generator. Having experienced many weekends like this, we felt that too many options leads to indecision, which leads to another weekend spent binge-watching House of Cards.</p>
        <p>To combat this, our site only displays up to three random options at once. Instead of planning out a date from the ground up, you lock in locations one at a time. Because the locations are randomized, and there is no back button, Date Idea Generator encourages people to step outside of their comfort zone.</p>

    <section class="planning">
      <h1>Planning</h1>
      <article>
        <p>As a group, we decided that randomizing the locations should be as easy as pressing a button, so we found a lot of inspiration from the color palette generator <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">Coolors.co.</a> We spent a decent amount of the planning period exploring possible sources of our date location info. Eventually, we decided on Yelp’s new Fusion v3 API.</p>
        <p>At first, we considered having users create accounts, but we eventually agreed that our site should be as easy to use as possible and that memorizing another password might be a barrier to our site’s usability.</p>

        <p>After three weeks of work, we demoed Date Idea Generator in front of our classmates and instructors at DevMountain. I enjoyed my experience collaborating with three other developers in my cohort.</p>
        <p>I learned a lot from working in a group environment, from discussing wireframes in Adobe XD to deciding how to aggregate our location data. I was lucky to be able to work with three hard-working devs.</p>

        <p>Peanut Gallery is a web scraper that I created to compile IMDb reviews for any given movie. After scraping all of the reviews for an IMDb title, the site makes them available for download as a single .txt or .html file.</p>

        <p>I wanted to learn more about how natural language corpora are built. Before making this site, I noticed that movie reviews have become a popular source of data for sentiment analysis because they are often opinionated and already labeled with ratings (usually on a scale from 1-5 or 1-10). Since I couldn’t find an API for user-generated movie reviews, I decided to scrape them myself.</p>

        <p>My first step was to convert movie titles to IMDb ID’s. I decided to use the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank">Open Movie Database API.</a> After that, I had a lot of fun figuring out the best way to scrape reviews from IMDb.</p>
        <p>At first, I parsed the HTML from each review page using <a href="https://cheerio.js.org/" target="_blank">a library called Cheerio.</a> However, while I was in the process of building my scraper, IMDb went through a total site redesign that broke it. After I discovered that I could access the AJAX for the reviews by changing my request URL, I changed my approach. Using AJAX instead of scraping their HTML, which was prone to change, made my scraper resilient to any future IMDb redesigns.</p>

        <p>Scraping all the reviews for a single movie title was my first step towards building a corpus. At one point, I re-wrote the scraper in Clojure, which gave me a better understanding of my code and of functional programming principles. Eventually, I re-worked the code to build a corpus of 1.5 million reviews across five movie genres (animation, comedy, documentary, horror, and romance).</p>
        <p>Eventually, I’d like to support JSON downloads to make the reviews more structured. I’d also like to allow users to upload a list of movie titles and download a single file with all the reviews labeled by movie.</p>
        <p>Peanut Gallery is not currently available online. But you can see the results of my journeys into web scraping in the slides below.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Yale’s Computer Science department focuses on fundamental topics in C and LISP. When HackYale was founded in 2011, there was a desire on campus for courses on additional topics outside the scope of the major.</p>
        <p>Specifically, there was a strong need for courses in web development and high-level programming languages. In fact, our <a href="https://github.com/hackyale/Web-Development-101" target="_blank">Introduction to Web Development course</a> regularly had 200+ applicants for ~30 spots.</p>

        <p>I taught the class to a group of CS students, an MBA from the Yale School of Management, and a PhD student in Astrophysics who wanted to retool as a Data Scientist. Over the course of three weeks, we covered corpus manipulation and analysis, n-gram language models, naive bayes text classification, and concluded by categorizing a dataset of news articles using a model we built with <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/reuters-21578+text+categorization+collection" target="_blank">the Reuters Text Classification Corpus.</a></p>

  <h1>Description</h1>
  <article>
    <p>When I was on the HackYale team, we taught courses on everything from C++ to web development and design. I decided to develop my own three-week course on Natural Language Processing using the Python Natural Language Toolkit.</p>

  <h1>Motivation</h1>
  <article>
    <p>Yaleâ€™s CS department focuses on fundament topics in C and LISP. When HackYale was founded in 2013, there was a desire on campus for courses on additional topics outside the scope of the major. Specifically, there was a strong need for web development courses (our web dev course had XXXXX applicants for XXXX spots, and was consistently the most popular of our course selections).</p>

  <article>
    <p>I taught my class to a group of CS students, an MBA from the Yale School of Management, and a PhD student in Astrophysics who wanted to retool as a Data Scientist. Over the course of three weeks, we covered corpus manipulation and analysis, n-gram language models, naive bayes text classification, and concluded by categorizing a dataset of Reuters articles using a model we built with the XXXXX corpus.</p>
